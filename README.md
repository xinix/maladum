# Unofficial Core Space App

Hi! My name is Nico and I love Core Space. Ever since I first saw it on
the [Esoteric Order of Gamers](https://www.orderofgamers.com/games/core-space/) I was hooked. I
bought the core game and every expansion available. In 2020 I backed the First Born kickstarter and
also got everything ðŸ˜‹. I even made a [Core Space App](https://xinix.github.io/core-space). So a few
years later I backed Maladum and got everything again ðŸ¤ª.

In 2022 I volunteered to demo First Born at Spiel in Essen, Germany and was lucky enough to be
selected. I demoed the game for two days and got to work with Colin, Steward and Simon. After Essen
I got the idea to make an App for Core Space where players can lookup the item tokens they find the
game and get a detailed explanation about the symbols.

In 2024 I helped the Battle Systems again at Spiel and they kindly asked if I wanted to make a
reference app for Maladum. I was thrilled and started working on it right away. I hope you like it!
