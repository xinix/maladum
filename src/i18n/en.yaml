about-me: >-
  Hi! My name is Nico and I love Core Space and Maladum. Ever since I first saw Core Space on 
  <a href="https://www.orderofgamers.com/games/core-space/" target="_blank">the Esoteric Order 
  of Gamers</a> I was hooked. I bought the core game and every expansion available. In 2020 I backed 
  the First Born kickstarter and also got everything ðŸ˜‹.<br><br>In 2022 I volunteered to 
  demo First Born at Spiel in Essen, Germany and was lucky enough to be selected. I demoed the game 
  for two days and got to work with Colin, Steward and Simon. After Essen I got the idea to make an 
  App for Core Space where players can lookup the item tokens they find the game and get a detailed 
  explanation about the symbols. A few years later I got everything for Maladum and decided to make 
  an App for that too.
